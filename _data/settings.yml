# About Section
blurb:
  Web and Coding Club is one of the biggest clubs of IIT Bombay. As a part of the Institute Technical Council, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. We believe that every student here at IITB should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.

# About SoC Section
about-soc-what-is-soc:
  The incentive is similar to ITSP, based on the current form of it, the fundamental difference is that one can choose from the ideas offered by mentors who are senior undergrads, doctorate students or professors, and in some exceptional cases, startups. It is not just about development by the way. We have mentors to take up programmes regarding competitive coding, scientific computation etc. too.
about-soc-why-participate:
  Our list of projects gives you a chance to pick up and work on any topic you are enthusiastic about. You have a chance to work on a variety of topics ranging from machine learning to app development. The projects will help you enhance your knowledge and strengthen your foundations as a programmer.

    content: "Seasons of Code is a programme launched by the WnCC, along the lines of GSoC without much greenery though. The idea is that one can choose from the projects offered by mentors who are senior undergrads, doctorate students or professors, and in some exceptional cases, startups. The projects floated span several genres, including Development, Scientific Computation, Machine Learning and Open Source. With most of the projects running in summer, we’ve also had projects that have extended into the semester and some in winter."
