        How much data is generated every minute across the world? You must have definitely come across the fact that 90% of world's data has been generated in the past 2 years!(From whichever year this fact is ðŸ˜œ) 
        </p>
<p class="display3" style = "font-size:22px;" >
Such a rapid rate of data generation along with issues such as data privacy coming up, often makes people wonder are centralized data storage platforms like google drive or iCloud really the way to go?<br><br>

This project aims to create a p2p data storage platform with blockchain based access control. Seems complicated? Not reallyâ€¦
There would be mainly 3 aspects to the project, the first would be to build the p2p data storage platform which we would be making with Node.js  using libraries such as webRTC. Next would be to build the system for access control and this is where blockchain comes in. We would be using a smart contract to keep track of who owns the file and who has access to it. <br><br>
So overall the concept is pretty simple, whenever you upload a file it would be broken into various parts which would be encrypted and then distributed amongst the peers connected along with making an appropriate entry in the blockchain. When you would try to access the file again the smart contract would return back the method to accessing the various segments if you are allowed access to that file. 
Prereqs: Enthusiasm to learn( though some experience in web development might be beneficial)<br>
